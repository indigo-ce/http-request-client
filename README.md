# ðŸª» http-request-client

A dependency client that handles HTTP requests in apps using the Swift Composable Architecture (TCA).
It is part of the [Indigo Stack](https://indigostack.org).

## Installation

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/indigo-ce/http-request-client", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then, add `HTTPRequestClient` to your target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
  .target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
      "HTTPRequestClient"
    ]
  )
]
```

## Usage

The library provides a `HTTPRequestClient` that has several helpers methods to handle sending requests and decoding the response.

```swift
public func send(
  _ request: URLRequest,
  urlSession: URLSession = .shared
) async throws -> (Data, HTTPURLResponse, UUID)

public func send<Success, Failure>(
    _ request: URLRequest,
    decoder: JSONDecoder = .init(),
    urlSession: URLSession = .shared
) async throws -> Result<Success, Failure> where Success: Decodable, Failure: Decodable

public func send<T>(
    _ request: URLRequest,
    decoder: JSONDecoder = .init(),
    urlSession: URLSession = .shared
) async throws -> T where T: Decodable
```

The above methods also have variants that support sending a `Request` type instance from the [HTTPRequestBuilder](https://github.com/4rays/http-request-builder) library.
For example:

```swift
public func send(
    _ request: Request,
    baseURL: String,
    urlSession: URLSession = .shared,
    cachePolicy: URLRequest.CachePolicy = .useProtocolCachePolicy,
    timeoutInterval: TimeInterval = 60
) async throws -> (Data, HTTPURLResponse, UUID)
```
